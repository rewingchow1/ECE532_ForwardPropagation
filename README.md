# Hardware Approach of Forward Propagation in Neural Network on FPGA

## Description:
Implemented a neural network built on hardware able to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Performance and accuracy will be sent from one FPGA where the neural network is to another FPGA and can be visualized on a PC which is connected by UART.
